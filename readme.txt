Feed Them Social allows you to add Instagram Feeds, Facebook Group Feeds, Twitter Feeds, and now YouTube Video Feeds to a page or post on Wordpress. 

== Description ==

**SPECIAL NOTE:** Widget support now available and the Twitter Feed has been updated to API 1.1! (Authenticated) [API 1.0 was eliminated March 5th 2013 by Twitter]

= Features include the following: =
  * Add as many social feeds as you want to a page or post!
  * Display any social feeds on any post, page or sidebar!
  * Easily generate all the shortcodes you need for any feed!

We now have easy to use widgets available for all the feeds. This premium edition also allows our basic shortcode to work with text widgets. [See Example Demo](http://www.slickremix.com/testblog/)

= Install from WordPress Dashboard =
  * Log into WordPress dashboard then click **Plugins** > **Add new** > Then under the title "Install Plugins" click **Upload** > **choose the zip** > **Activate the plugin!**

== Changelog ==

= Version 1.1.8 February 18th, 2013 =
 * Updated: Twitter Feed updated to API v.1.1. Twitters old API (v1) has been deprecated but this plugin still works.
 
= Version 1.1.7 February 15th, 2013 =
 * Updated: Instagram, Facebook Group, YouTube, Twitter Feed, and shortcodes now work with widgets in our [Premium Version](http://www.slickremix.com/product/feed-them-social-premium-extension/). CSS styles for all feeds have had minor tweaks, including new styles for widget feeds.
 * Fixed: Spelling of permissions in facebook group feed.
 * We are still working on a twitter solution to all those faithfull followers. As of March Twitter will be changing the api for feeds, so a [newer limit will be set on calls](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/new-api-severely-restricts-third-party-twitter-applications/). To many calls to the api an hour from one IP address are most likely the cause for your errors, if you have been experienceing them currently.
